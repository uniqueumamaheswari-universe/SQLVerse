**🎯 Quality Education for Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime — 💫 with Comfort, Convenience at no Cost**

## 🧠 Exercise 1: INNER JOIN Practice – The Perfect Match

You've learned how `INNER JOIN` works – matching rows from two tables where the foreign key equals the primary key. Now it's time to practice these skills on the **Training Institution database** – the same one you'll use for the rest of the Module 4 practice exercises. You'll connect students to their enrollments, courses to their instructors, and payments to the students who made them.

## 🌌 SQLVerse Check-In

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #9c27b0; background-color: #f3e5f5; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;">

**You are now on Education Planet.** The laws of joins are universal. Whether you're matching students to enrollments or customers to orders, the logic is the same – only the data changes.

### 🔍 SQLVerse Artisan's Objective

In this exercise, you will move beyond single-table queries. You will learn to **bridge** tables using foreign keys, retrieve related data from multiple sources, and answer questions that span the entire database.

**The difference between a coder and an Artisan is discipline.**

## 💡 Artisan's Pro‑Tips for INNER JOIN

1. **Always use table aliases** – `students s`, `courses c` – to keep queries readable.
2. **The `ON` clause defines the bridge** – usually `table1.foreign_key = table2.primary_key`.
3. **`INNER JOIN` only returns matching rows** – if a student has no enrollments, they won't appear.
4. **You can join more than two tables** – but start with two, then add more gradually.
5. **Column names don't have to match** – you join on `student_id` in one table and `student_id` in another, but they could be named differently (e.g., `id` and `student_fk`).

## 🧪 Challenges

For each challenge, use the **Artisan's Query Rhythm**:
- **The Question** – read the business request.
- **The Query** – write your SQL.
- **Expected Result** – predict what you should see.
- **Try it now** – run it in Tab 2.
- **Reflect & Learn** – compare actual with expectation.

---

### Challenge 1: Students and Their Enrollments
**Question:** Show all students who are enrolled in at least one course. Display the student's full name (concatenate `first_name` and `last_name` as `student_name`), the course ID, and the enrollment date. Order by student name.

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Save as: 4-1-1-students-enrollments.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Only students with enrollments appear (Sarah, Mike, Jessica, David, Lisa, Alex, Maria, James, Priya, Carlos).  
**What this teaches:** Basic `INNER JOIN` between `students` and `enrollments`.

---

### Challenge 2: Courses and Their Instructors
**Question:** Show all courses with their instructor names. Display `course_name`, `course_track`, and the instructor's full name (as `instructor_name`). Order by course name.

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Save as: 4-1-2-courses-instructors.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Every course appears with its assigned instructor (Emily Watson teaches WD101 and WD201, James Wilson teaches WD102 and WD103, etc.).  
**What this teaches:** `INNER JOIN` using the `instructor_id` foreign key.

---

### Challenge 3: Payments with Student Names
**Question:** Show all payments made by students. Display the student's full name (`student_name`), payment amount, payment date, and payment method. Order by payment date descending (newest first).

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Save as: 4-1-3-payments-students.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Every payment row shows which student made it. Students who haven't paid anything (James Wilson with student_id 108) will not appear because `INNER JOIN` only shows matches.  
**What this teaches:** `INNER JOIN` between `payments` and `students`.

---

### Challenge 4: Completed Courses with Scores
**Question:** Show all completed enrollments where the student passed (final exam score >= 60). Display the student's full name, course name, and final exam score. Order by score descending (highest first).

> 💡 **Artisan's Note:** The condition `final_exam_score >= 60` should be applied **after** the joins, not inside them. Keep your `ON` clauses for defining relationships only. Use `WHERE` for filtering the result.

*Hint: You'll need to join students to enrollments, and then enrollments to courses.*

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Save as: 4-1-4-completed-courses.sql
```
**Expected Result:** Students who completed courses with scores >= 60. Alex Kumar appears with 97 in Frontend Development.  
**What this teaches:** Joining three tables (`students` → `enrollments` → `courses`) with a `WHERE` filter.

---

### Challenge 5: Web Development Courses Only
**Question:** Show all students enrolled in 'Web Development' track courses. Display the student's full name, course name, and enrollment date. Order by student name, then by course name.

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Hint: You'll need to join students → enrollments → courses, then filter by course_track = 'Web Development'
-- Save as: 4-1-5-webdev-students.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Only students in Web Development courses (WD101, WD102, WD103, WD201) appear.  
**What this teaches:** Joining three tables with a `WHERE` filter on a column from the third table.

---

### Challenge 6: Students Who Paid More Than $1000
**Question:** Show all students who have made a single payment greater than $1000. Display the student's full name, payment amount, and payment date. Order by payment amount descending.

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Save as: 4-1-6-large-payments.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Students with payments > $1000 (Sarah, Mike, David, Alex, Priya, Carlos).  
**What this teaches:** `INNER JOIN` with a numeric filter on the `payments` table.

---

### Challenge 7: Instructor's Course Load 

**Question:** Show each instructor and **count the number of courses per instructor**. Display the instructor's full name and the count of courses (as `courses_taught`). Only include instructors who are currently assigned to at least one course. Order by course count descending.

```sql
-- Your query here
-- Hint: You'll need to join instructors to courses and use COUNT(*) with GROUP BY
-- Save as: 4-1-7-instructor-load.sql
```

**Expected Result:** Emily Watson teaches 2 courses, James Wilson teaches 2, Maria Garcia teaches 2, Robert Chen teaches 1, Ahmed Khan teaches 1.  
**What this teaches:** `INNER JOIN` with aggregation (`GROUP BY` and `COUNT`).

## 💎 DESIGNER'S PERIGON

### *The Art of Connection*

You've learned to split data into clean, normalized tables. Now you're learning to bring it back together. `INNER JOIN` is the perfect match – it shows you only what belongs together.

In the **SQLVerse**, `INNER JOIN` is the handshake between tables. It says, *"You have this ID; I have the same ID. Let's share our stories."*

> *“A join without a condition is chaos. A join with a precise condition is a masterpiece.”*

In the Artisan's Garden, `INNER JOIN` is a **monochromatic bouquet** – by keeping the hue consistent, you create depth and **modern elegance.** This **minimalist approach** highlights the natural elegance of blooms and brings a refined sophistication to the floral arrangement.

### 🌍 Real‑World Application

The `INNER JOIN` queries you just wrote power business features you interact with every day. Behind every report, every dashboard, every "Your Account" page – there's a join connecting your data across multiple tables.

#### The Three Queries That Run the World

| Query | Real‑World Scenario | Business Impact |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 📊 **Student Enrollment Report** | A training manager needs to know which students are enrolled in which courses. Without `INNER JOIN`, they would manually cross-reference two spreadsheets. With your query, they get the answer in milliseconds. | **Time saved:** Hours per week. **Accuracy:** 100%. |
| 👨‍🏫 **Instructor Course Load** | A department head must balance teaching assignments. If one instructor is overloaded while another has no courses, student experience suffers. Your aggregation query reveals the imbalance instantly. | **Resource optimization:** Right-sized workloads. **Student satisfaction:** No canceled courses. |
| 💰 **Payment Tracker** | An accounts receivable team needs to match payments to student accounts. A missing join means orphaned payments – money received but not credited. Your query ensures every dollar is accounted for. | **Financial integrity:** No lost revenue. **Audit readiness:** Every payment traced to a student. |

#### The Cost of Missing a Join

Imagine a university that stores students in one table and enrollments in another – but never joins them. The registrar cannot answer: *"Which students are in Data Science?"* The finance team cannot answer: *"Which students owe fees?"* The university operates in the dark.

| Without JOIN | With INNER JOIN |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Data sits in isolated silos | Data becomes connected knowledge |
| Manual cross-referencing (errors guaranteed) | Automated relationships (precision guaranteed) |
| "I think this student is enrolled" | "This student is enrolled – here's the proof" |

#### The Artisan's Advantage

Every time you write an `INNER JOIN`, you are building a bridge between two worlds. The `students` table knows who they are. The `enrollments` table knows what they're doing. Together, they tell the complete story.

> *“The queries you wrote are not just syntax exercises – they are the logic behind real business decisions. A CEO doesn't care about your JOIN syntax. They care that you can tell them which courses are making money.”*

#### Your Portfolio Proof

When an interviewer asks, *"Can you write a JOIN?"* – every candidate says yes. When they ask, *"What business problem does an INNER JOIN solve?"* – **you** will say: *"It connects students to their enrollments so a training manager can see active courses. It connects payments to students so finance can track who owes money. It connects instructors to courses so a department head can balance workload."*

**That answer gets you hired.**

**The SQLVerse expands. Go build connections.**
