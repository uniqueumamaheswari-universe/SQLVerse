## Table Grain vs. Query Grain & Grain Alignment

**Document Type:** Grain Foundations — Part 2 of 3  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** FROZEN  
**Location:** `SQLVerse-Architects-Blueprint/01-GRAIN-FOUNDATIONS/`  
**Governing Standard:** `SQLVERSE-ARCH-FW-001`

## 🔗 From the Architect's Blueprint

In **ACQUIRE Files 2 & 3**, you learned how tables stay connected through Foreign Keys and how relationships are classified (1:1, 1:N, M:N). You built junction tables like `order_items` and `LoanApplications` to resolve many-to-many relationships.

**You learned:**

- Foreign Keys tell you that tables are connected.
- Relationships tell you what kind of connection exists (1:1, 1:N, M:N).
- The Refactoring Lab showed you how to build and join a normalized structure.

You know **how** tables are connected. Now we examine **what happens when connected tables operate at different grains**.

* A `customers` row represents **One Customer**.
* An `orders` row represents **One Order**.
* An `order_items` row represents **One Line Item in an Order**.

**Now we ask a deeper question:**

> **What happens when connected tables represent different grains?**

## 📌 Purpose

This is the second of three foundational documents on **Grain**.

In **Grain 01**, you learned what table grain is and how to identify it.

**This document bridges data modeling theory and SQL execution mechanics.**

Now you will learn:

- The difference between **Table Grain** (physical storage) and **Query Grain** (the result of a `GROUP BY`).
- Why **Required Grain** and **Available Grain** are the key to analytical correctness.
- What happens when tables with different grains are joined — and how to prevent **fan‑out** (row multiplication).
- Why **SQL can run perfectly and still produce a wrong answer.**

## 🧠 Two Kinds of Grain

### From Grain Basics to Query Grain

In **01 — Grain Basics**, you learned that every table in a database has a **Table Grain** — a real-world business definition of what a single row represents.

Now we transition from static schemas to active execution.

When you write a `SELECT` statement—especially one containing `JOIN`s, `GROUP BY` clauses, or aggregate functions—you construct a new, temporary table in memory. That query result **also has a grain**.

```text
TABLE GRAIN
│
└── What does ONE row in this table represent?
│
│
QUERY GRAIN
│
└── What does ONE row in the query result represent?
```

**Table Grain** is fixed. It is defined by the schema.

**Query Grain** is dynamic. It is the level of detail represented by one row in the query result. `GROUP BY` explicitly defines the grouping grain of an aggregated result, while joins can change the underlying row set and its grain.

**Table Grain**  ──▶  The level of detail stored in a physical base table
**Query Grain**  ──▶  The level of detail produced by an executed SQL statement

---

>⚠️ **The Critical Law of Analytical Correctness:**
>
>If the **Query Grain** does not match the **Business Question Grain**, the query's answer is mathematically wrong—even if the SQL syntax executes without errors.

---

### Table Grain — Physical Storage

```text
customers
→ one row = one customer

orders
→ one row = one order

order_items
→ one row = one order line

products
→ one row = one product
```

A table has a defined grain at a given schema version. 

A query can change the grain of its result without changing the stored table grain.

```text
You can GROUP BY customer_id to get one row per customer.
You can GROUP BY order_id to get one row per order.
You cannot disaggregate a summary row back into individual order items.
```

---

### Query Grain — The Analytical Result

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Query Grain:** One row = one customer with their total spend.

```sql
SELECT order_date, COUNT(*) AS daily_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_date;
```

**Query Grain:** One row = one day with its order count.

**The Rule:**
> **Table Grain is physical. Query Grain is analytical.**
>
> **You can aggregate upward. You cannot disaggregate downward.**

## 🔍 Required Grain vs. Available Grain

This is one of the most important diagnostic questions you will ever ask. In a business scenario the Required grain must provide the level of detail the stakeholder expects.

When a business request arrives, an **SQLVerse Artisan** evaluates two states:

| State | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| **Available Grain** | The level of detail your tables actually store. |
| **Required Grain** | The level of detail the business analysis needs. |

When these don't line up, you either can't answer the question directly, or you risk wrong numbers — especially after joins.

---

### 🧠 Core Idea in One Line

- **Required Grain** = *"What should one row in my result represent?"*
- **Available Grain** = *"What does one row in each source table represent today?"*

You must consciously align them before aggregating or joining.

---

### 📊 The Diagnostic Framework

```text
REQUIRED GRAIN
      │
      └── What grain does the business question demand?
      │
      │
AVAILABLE GRAIN
      │
      └── What grain does the table actually store?
```

| Condition | Outcome |
|-----------|---------|
| Required Grain is **finer** than Available Grain | ❌ **The model cannot answer the question** |
| Required Grain is **coarser** than Available Grain | ⚙️ **We need to aggregate** |
| Required grain can be constructed from **multiple available grains** | 🔧 **We must plan how the grains interact** |

## 🍽️ A Simple Real‑World Example: The Restaurant Chain

You have a restaurant chain **“SpiceRoute”** with multiple branches in Chennai:

- Branches: `SR-Anna Nagar`, `SR-T Nagar`, `SR-Adyar`, etc.
- Each branch takes many **bills** per day.
- Each bill has multiple **line items** (dishes, drinks, etc.).

You want to answer questions like:

> *"What was the total sales per branch per month?"*
> *"What was the average bill value per branch per day?"*
> *"Which menu items are most popular at each branch?"*

This is a classic multi‑grain business domain:

| Table | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `branches` | One branch |
| `bills` | One bill |
| `bill_items` | One line item in a bill |

**These tables are related — but they do not have the same grain.**

That is the first step toward understanding analytical correctness.

## 📌 Hand‑Off to 02B

You have now learned the core diagnostic framework:

- Table Grain vs. Query Grain
- Required Grain vs. Available Grain
- The Restaurant Chain domain and its three tables

In `02B-restaurant-chain-pattern-analysis.md`, you will apply this framework to six real business questions — each with a different grain — and see exactly how to diagnose, plan, and execute the correct query.

**You will learn:**

- How to identify the required grain for each business question.
- How to map the available grain from the tables.
- How to decide between safe aggregation, direct joining, and aggregation‑first strategies.
- How to verify that your query grain is correct using count validation.
