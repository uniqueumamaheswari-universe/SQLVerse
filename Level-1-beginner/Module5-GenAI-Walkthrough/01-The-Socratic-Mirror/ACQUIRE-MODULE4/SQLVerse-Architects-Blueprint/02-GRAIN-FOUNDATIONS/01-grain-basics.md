# 01 — Grain Basics

## Table Grain, Primary Keys, and Business Meaning

**Document Type:** Grain Foundations — Part 1 of 3  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** FROZEN  
**Location:** `SQLVerse-Architects-Blueprint/01-GRAIN-FOUNDATIONS/`  
**Governing Standard:** `SQLVERSE-ARCH-FW-001`

## 🔗 From the Architect's Blueprint: The Shift to Grain

In the **ACQUIRE Architect’s Blueprint**, you learned the foundational rule of database normalization:

> **"One Fact, One Place."**

- **Normalization** taught you that facts belong in the correct table.
- **Foreign keys** taught you how those facts are connected.
- **The Refactoring Lab** taught you to transform a flat structure into a relational one.

You saw how flat, unnormalized tables introduce insert, update, and delete anomalies, and you learned to decompose them into distinct, themed entities (`products`, `categories`, `customers`).

Normalization taught you **where facts belong**. 

**Grain** takes the next step by asking: **What does ONE ROW actually represent inside that entity?**

* Normalization separates concepts so data isn't duplicated.
* Grain defines the precise boundary and meaning of a single record.

Before analyzing or querying a normalized table, you must state its Grain. If you cannot define what one row represents, you cannot write an analytically correct query.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This is the first of three foundational documents on **Grain** — the single most important concept in data modeling and analytical correctness.

By the end of this document, you will understand:

- What **table grain** means and why it matters.
- How **Primary Keys** define the grain of a table.
- The difference between **entity grain**, **event grain**, and **transaction grain**.
- Why **"one row"** is a business statement, not merely a technical statement.
- How to identify the grain of any table by examining its structure.

---

## 🧠 What is Grain?

In data modeling, **grain** (or granularity) refers to the **level of detail represented by a single row in a table**.

```text
Table Grain = The real-world entity or event represented by exactly ONE row in a table
```

Every table in a database has a grain. Understanding that grain is the foundation of:

- Writing correct `JOIN`s
- Performing accurate aggregations
- Designing defensible schemas
- Diagnosing data model gaps

### 🍽️ A Simple Real‑World Example: A Restaurant Chain

Imagine a Restaurant chain selling food. You can model its sales data at different granularities.

---

#### 1. Fine‑Grained (High Granularity)

**One row = one line item on a bill**

| bill_id | line_number | product_id | quantity | price | branch_id | sale_timestamp      |
|---------|-------------|------------|----------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| 1001    | 1           | P001       | 2        | 50    | B01      | 2026-09-06 10:15:23 |
| 1001    | 2           | P020       | 1        | 120   | B01      | 2026-09-06 10:15:23 |
| 1002    | 1           | P001       | 1        | 50    | B02      | 2026-09-06 10:22:05 |

**Grain:** *"One row = one line item on one bill at one point in time."*

This is very detailed. You can answer questions like:

- *How many units of product P001 were sold at branch B01 between 10:00 and 11:00?*
- *What was the average price per unit for product P020 last week?*

---

#### 2. Coarse‑Grained (Low Granularity)

**One row = total sales per branch per day**

Now aggregate the same data:

| branch_id | sale_date  | total_quantity | total_revenue |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|
| B01      | 2026-09-06 | 150            | 12500         |
| B02      | 2026-09-06 | 95             | 8900          |

**Grain:** *"One row = total sales for one branch on one day."*

You've lost the per‑bill and per‑product detail, but it's perfect for questions like:

- *What was total revenue per branch yesterday?*
- *Which branch had the highest sales today?*

### 🧠 How to Think About Granularity in SQL

Ask: **"What does one row represent?"** That answer is your grain.

| Attribute | Fine Granularity | Coarse Granularity |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Rows** | More rows | Fewer rows |
| **Detail** | More detail | Less detail |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible analysis | Less flexible analysis |
| **Use Case** | Detailed transactional queries | Summary reports |
| **Aggregation** | Can aggregate upward | Cannot disaggregate |

> 💡 **The Artisan's Rule:** *Fine granularity gives you flexibility. Coarse granularity gives you speed. Choose based on the business question — but always know what one row represents.*

### 🧪 The SQLVerse Artisan's Garden — A Revisit

Do you remember the **SQLVerse Artisan's Garden** from the Refactoring Lab?

You transformed the flat E-Store into a relational structure:

```text
products (flat)
│
├── product_id
├── product_name
├── category
└── price
```

became:

```text
categories
│
└── category_id
        ↑
        │ FK
        │
products
├── product_id
├── product_name
├── category_id
└── price
```

You learned that **Normalization** is Landscape Design.

Now let's walk back through the Garden and ask a different question:

> **What does ONE ROW represent?**

| Table | One row represents |
|-------|-------------------|
| `categories` | One product category |
| `products` | One product |

**Now observe:**

```text
categories (category grain)
     │
     │ 1:N
     ▼
products (product grain)
```

**The tables are related — but each table has its own grain.**

That is the first step toward understanding analytical correctness.

> 🌱 *"The Garden is the same. Your lens has changed."*

---

## 🔍 Grain is a Business Statement, Not a Technical Statement

A common mistake is to define grain solely by the Primary Key columns:

```text
order_items
PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id)
```

A student might say: *"The grain is `(order_id, product_id)`."*

That is technically correct. But it misses the point.

The correct business statement is:

> **One row represents one product line within one order.**

Or more precisely:

> **One row represents one unique product SKU ordered as part of a specific customer purchase transaction.**

The grain is not the columns. The grain is **what the columns represent in the real world**.

---
## 🔗 Revisiting the Refactoring Lab

You already built this structure in the Refactoring Lab:

```text
categories
-----------
category_id | category_name

products
-----------
product_id | product_name | category_id | price
```

**Now ask:**

| Table | What does ONE ROW represent? |
|-------|------------------------------|
| `categories` | One category (e.g., "Electronics") |
| `products` | One product (e.g., "Laptop") |

This may seem obvious here.

It will not always be obvious.

---

## 📊 High Granularity vs. Low Granularity

| Attribute | Fine-Grained (Atomic) | Coarse-Grained (Summarized) |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------------------|
| **One Row =** | Specific transaction line item | Rollup / summary state |
| **Level of Detail** | Maximum detail | Minimum detail |
| **Information Loss** | None | Cannot disaggregate |
| **Example** | `Order_Items (order_id, product_id)` | `Products (product_id)` |

```text
FINE-GRAINED
More individual facts
More detail
Less aggregation

COARSE-GRAINED
More summarized facts
Less detail
More aggregation
```

> 💡 **In data modeling, fine-grained data is often described as having higher granularity.**

---

## 🏛️ The Universal Grain Rule

> **The Primary Key defines identity. The Grain defines meaning.**

A table's Primary Key enforces uniqueness — it guarantees that no two rows are identical.

But the Grain tells you **what that unique row actually represents**.

| Table | Primary Key | Grain (Business Statement) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `students` | `student_id` | One row = one enrolled student |
| `orders` | `order_id` | One row = one customer purchase order |
| `order_items` | `(order_id, product_id)` | One row = one product line within one order |
| `payments` | `payment_id` | One row = one payment transaction |
| `loan_payments` | `payment_id` | One row = one installment payment against a loan |

---

## 📋 Grain Types

### 1. Entity Grain

A row represents a **person, place, or thing** — an entity that exists independently of events.

| Table | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `students` | One student |
| `doctors` | One doctor |
| `customers` | One customer |
| `products` | One product |
| `properties` | One property |

### 2. Event Grain

A row represents an **event** — something that happened at a specific point in time.

| Table | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `appointments` | One scheduled appointment |
| `orders` | One customer order |
| `transactions` | One financial transaction |
| `viewings` | One property viewing |
| `offers` | One offer on a property |

### 3. Transaction Grain

A row represents a **line item or component** of a larger transaction.

| Table | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `order_items` | One product line within one order |
| `loan_payments` | One installment payment against a loan |
| `appointment_treatments` | One treatment performed during one appointment |

---

## 🔍 How to Identify Grain

### Step 1: Look at the Primary Key

The Primary Key (or composite key) defines the grain.

```sql
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INTEGER,
    product_id INTEGER,
    quantity INTEGER,
    price REAL
);
```

**Grain:** One row = one order item (one product line within one order).

### Step 2: Ask the Question

> **What does exactly ONE row in this table represent?**

- If you can answer in a single sentence that includes the real‑world entity or event, you have identified the grain.
- If you cannot, the grain is not well-defined — and that is a design problem.

### Step 3: Test with Sample Data

Look at actual rows and ask:

```text
Row 1: order_id = 101, product_id = 201, quantity = 2, price = 45.00
Row 2: order_id = 101, product_id = 202, quantity = 1, price = 65.00
Row 3: order_id = 102, product_id = 201, quantity = 3, price = 45.00
```

**Grain:** One row represents one product in a specific order.

---

## ⚠️ Why Grain Matters

### 1. Aggregations

If you don't know the grain, you don't know what your `SUM`, `AVG`, or `COUNT` actually measures.

| Query | Correct Grain | Result Meaning |
|-------|---------------|----------------|
| `SUM(price)` on `order_items` | One row = one product line | Total product‑line revenue across all orders |
| `COUNT(order_id)` on `orders` | One row = one order | Total number of orders |

### 2. JOINs

If you join tables with different grains without understanding them, you risk **fan‑out** — row multiplication that distorts your results.

This will be explored in detail in **`02-grain-in-practice.md`**.

### 3. Schema Design

If you design a table without defining its grain, you create ambiguity. Ambiguity leads to:

- Incorrect aggregations
- Unreliable reports
- Silent data corruption
- Costly schema migrations

## 🏛️ The SQLVerse Grain Principle

> **You can aggregate upward, but you cannot recover detail that was never stored.**

If you store data at a coarse grain (e.g., daily summaries), you can never answer questions that require transaction‑level detail.

If you store data at a fine grain (e.g., individual transactions), you can always aggregate upward to produce summaries.

```text
FINE GRAIN
(Transactions)
      │
      ▼
  Aggregated Upward
      │
      ▼
COARSE GRAIN
(Summaries)

❌ Cannot go back down
```

**This is the single most important principle in analytical data modeling.**

## 🔍 Self-Assessment

After reading this document, test yourself on the following tables:

| Table | Primary Key | What does ONE row represent? |
|-------|-------------|------------------------------|
| `students` | `student_id` | |
| `orders` | `order_id` | |
| `order_items` | `(order_id, product_id)` | |
| `patients` | `patient_id` | |
| `appointments` | `appointment_id` | |
| `bills` | `bill_id` | |

**Answers:**

| Table | Grain |
|-------|-------|
| `students` | One row = one enrolled student |
| `orders` | One row = one customer purchase order |
| `order_items` | One row = one product line within one order |
| `patients` | One row = one patient |
| `appointments` | One row = one scheduled appointment |
| `bills` | One row = one bill issued to a patient |
